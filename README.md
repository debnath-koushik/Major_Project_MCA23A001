# Lung Carcinoma Classification Using CNN with Denoising Techniques

## Project Title
**A Comparative Study on Denoising of Megapixel and Gigapixel Histopathological Images for Improved Classification of Lung Carcinoma**

## Abstract
Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers globally, often diagnosed in later stages. This project addresses the classification of lung carcinoma using deep learning on histopathological images. The study compares denoising techniques, particularly the Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm, to enhance image quality and improve classification accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed model effectively distinguishes between **adenocarcinoma** and **squamous cell carcinoma**, even in noisy image conditions.

## Key Features
- Classification of lung cancer subtypes from histopathological images.
- Application of advanced denoising methods (Non-Local Means).
- Deep CNN architecture with:
  - 8 Convolutional layers
  - 3 Pooling layers
  - 3 Fully Connected layers
- Evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MCC, etc.
- Dataset augmentation and normalization.
- Achieved 99–100% accuracy on denoised data.

Due to privacy and ethical concerns, the original clinical dataset used in this research (collected from Barasat Hospital and Gujarat Cancer Research Institute) cannot be shared.

However, for demonstration and testing purposes, we used a public dataset from Kaggle:

### ✅ Test Dataset Used: [LC25000 - Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images)

- **Total Images:** 25,000  
- **Image Size:** 768 x 768 pixels  
- **File Format:** JPEG
